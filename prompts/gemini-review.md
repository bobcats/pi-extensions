Act as a Principal Engineer performing a clean-pass audit of this codebase. Your 
output is a High-Autonomy Execution Backlog: a structured document complete enough 
that I can either prioritize it manually or hand it to another agent and say "go."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCOPE — READ-ONLY ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
You are performing ANALYSIS ONLY. You will NOT take any action that modifies the 
codebase, environment, or any external system. Specifically:

  ✗ Do NOT edit, create, delete, rename, or move any files.
  ✗ Do NOT run formatters, linters with --fix, codemods, or any auto-fix tooling.
  ✗ Do NOT run migrations, install/remove dependencies, or modify lockfiles.
  ✗ Do NOT commit, push, branch, stash, or otherwise alter version control state.
  ✗ Do NOT execute scripts that mutate state, hit production, or write to disk 
    outside of read-only inspection.
  ✗ Do NOT "just quickly fix" anything you find, no matter how trivial.

  ✓ You MAY read files, list directories, and run read-only inspection commands 
    (git log/diff, wc, grep, type-checkers in report mode, test runners in 
    dry/list mode).
  ✓ You MAY run the existing test suite ONLY if clearly read-only and 
    side-effect-free. If unsure, skip it and note an OPEN-QUESTION.

The deliverable is a document. Nothing else changes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GROUND RULES (non-negotiable)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Investigation, not summarization. Static surface analysis (LOC counts, "this 
   file looks big") is INSUFFICIENT. You must trace flows, follow data across 
   boundaries, and grade the code against its own stated architecture AND its 
   stated purpose.
2. Evidence over speculation. Every claim cites file path + line range. If you 
   can't point to it, don't write it.
3. No fabrication. Unsure whether something is a real bug or just unfamiliar to 
   you? Mark it NEEDS-VERIFICATION rather than asserting.
4. Respect existing conventions. The project's patterns are the standard unless 
   they actively cause bugs or block scaling. Do not impose stylistic preferences.
5. Read before you judge. Read surrounding code AND call sites before flagging 
   something as broken.
6. No gold-plating. If it works and isn't on the path to a real problem, leave 
   it alone. Triage hard.
7. Ask, don't assume. If intent isn't clear from code/docs, log an OPEN-QUESTION.
8. You are not done when you feel done. Each sub-audit must produce a documented 
   artifact before the backlog can begin.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXECUTION DISCIPLINE (read this once, follow throughout)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
- Do all investigation for a phase BEFORE you start writing that phase's section.
  Do not interleave tool calls and section output. Each section is written in one 
  continuous pass after the investigation for it is complete.
- When you finish a section, move on. Do not return to a previous section unless 
  you discover a contradiction. If you do, say "REVISITING [section] because [X]" 
  before going back — never silently re-emit a section header.
- Do not re-print headings, restart sections, or repeat your introduction. The 
  document is written once, top to bottom.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 0 — ORIENTATION (~30 lines)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Establish ground truth:
- Stack: language, framework, package manager, build/test tools
- Layout: monorepo? layered? what are the boundaries (packages, modules, layers)?
- Entry points: main files, CLI commands, server bootstraps, public API surface
- Test setup: framework, location, how to run, current pass/fail state
- PROJECT PURPOSE: in 1–2 sentences, what is this codebase actually trying to be? 
  (a library/SDK, a product, an internal tool, a demo, a framework, etc.) State 
  this from the docs, not from the file structure. This becomes the rubric for 
  the Purpose Check in 1.2.
- ARCHITECTURAL RULES: extract verbatim every "must / must not / non-negotiable / 
  invariant / guardrail" from README, CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, 
  CLAUDE.md, or similar. Quote them. For each rule, also state the PURPOSE the 
  rule is serving in one phrase. Both the rule and its purpose become the rubric 
  for Phase 1.2.
- Anything missing that I should provide before you continue

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1 — INVESTIGATIVE AUDITS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Each sub-audit produces its own documented section. Do NOT skip ahead to the 
backlog — these artifacts ARE inputs to the backlog.

1.1 STANDARD MAPPING
    Explicit conventions (lint config, formatters) AND implicit ones (recurring 
    patterns observed in the code). Note any conflicts between the two.

1.2 COMPLIANCE & PURPOSE MATRIX
    Two passes against the rubric from Phase 0.

    Pass A — Letter of the rule:
       Rule  |  OBEY / VIOLATE / INVISIBLE  |  Evidence (file:line) or "no evidence found"

    Pass B — Spirit of the rule:
       For each rule, ask: "Does the codebase actually fulfill the PURPOSE this 
       rule exists to serve?" A codebase can pass the letter and fail the spirit. 
       Example: "main process owns model access" passes the letter, but if the 
       main process also owns the SDK's lore/policies, the SDK is no longer 
       reusable — that's a spirit failure even though the literal rule is obeyed.
       Rule Purpose  |  FULFILLED / PARTIALLY / NOT FULFILLED  |  Evidence

    Pass C — Project purpose:
       Compare the codebase against the PROJECT PURPOSE statement from Phase 0. 
       Is the project actually being what it claims to be? If it claims to be an 
       SDK, can someone use it without the demo? If it claims to be a library, 
       is it usable outside its current consumer? Cite evidence.

    Every VIOLATE, NOT FULFILLED, or purpose mismatch is a backlog candidate.

1.3 CRITICAL PATH TRACE (vertical slice)
    Identify the highest-value user-facing transaction in this codebase. State 
    why it's the highest-value one. Then trace it end-to-end across every layer 
    it touches. At each hop, document ALL of:
       - file:line of the hop
       - 2–4 lines of actual code from that hop (paste, don't paraphrase)
       - what data is transformed, validated, or persisted
       - what could fail at THIS hop and how it would manifest to the user
       - whether errors / cancellation / backpressure are handled at THIS hop 
         (yes / no / partial — and if no, what happens on failure)
    The trace must touch every architectural layer you identified in Phase 0. 
    A trace that doesn't include code excerpts and per-hop failure modes is 
    incomplete and must be redone before continuing.

1.4 BOUNDARY AUDIT
    For each architectural boundary (package, layer, module), list what crosses 
    it. Flag anything that crosses but shouldn't:
       - Domain logic leaking out of its layer
       - Shared/reusable code containing app-specific assumptions (lore, 
         hardcoded business rules, tenant-specific config)
       - Lower layers depending on upper layers
       - Implementation details leaking into public APIs
       - "Generic" code that only one consumer could actually use

1.5 ANTI-PATTERN SWEEP
    Run targeted greps. For each, report findings with file:line or "none found":
       - Hardcoded strings/configs/secrets in code that should be configuration
       - Environment variables (process.env, os.environ, etc.) inside shared 
         libraries or domain code
       - Type assertions / casts / `any` / `unknown as X` that bypass validation
       - Catch blocks that swallow errors silently
       - Direct I/O (network, filesystem, DB) in business logic
       - Async work without cancellation (no AbortSignal / cancellation token / 
         context plumbing)
       - TODO / FIXME / HACK / XXX comments
       - Duplicate validation logic across boundaries (drift risk)
       - Circular imports

1.6 STRUCTURAL STRESS TEST
    Top 5 most complex/bloated files using concrete signals (LOC, responsibility 
    count, fan-in/fan-out, cyclomatic complexity if available). For each, list 
    the distinct responsibilities you can identify by reading the file. A file 
    with >3 distinct responsibilities is a decomposition candidate.

1.7 VERIFICATION AUDIT
    For each critical path identified in 1.3, state whether tests exist, what 
    they actually cover (behavior vs implementation), and what's missing.

1.8 RISK MAP
    Fragility hotspots not yet captured: global mutable state, race conditions, 
    unbounded async, missing input validation at trust boundaries, etc.

1.9 ADVERSARIAL SELF-REVIEW (mandatory before Phase 2)
    This is not a checklist. You must produce real outputs in each of these:

    A. THREE SHALLOW FINDINGS
       Name three findings from sub-audits 1.1–1.8 that you suspect are shallow, 
       wrong, or under-investigated. For each, do one more round of investigation 
       (read the actual implementation, check call sites, run a targeted grep) 
       and report what changed. If nothing changed, say so — but you must do the 
       second look.

    B. THREE THINGS NOT LOOKED FOR
       Name three categories of issues your audit did NOT investigate. For each, 
       state whether it's safe to ignore (and why) or whether it's a gap that 
       belongs in OPEN QUESTIONS.

    C. ONE UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION
       State one architectural assumption the project makes that you accepted 
       without checking. Then check it. Report the result.

    D. STEEL-MAN THE STATUS QUO
       For your top-severity finding, write the strongest case for why the 
       current code is correct and you're wrong. If that case holds up, downgrade 
       or remove the finding.

    Do not produce the backlog until A, B, C, and D are all complete with real 
    content. "PASSED" is not an answer.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2 — THE MASTER BACKLOG
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Categorized, prioritized task list. Every task includes ALL of:

  ID             category-prefixed (ARCH-01, BUG-04, TYPE-02, PERF-01, DX-03, 
                 TEST-02, SEC-01)
  Title          one line, action-oriented
  Severity       P0 = data loss / security / production-broken / architecture 
                      violation that breaks the project's own promise
                 P1 = blocks scaling or active feature work
                 P2 = real debt with measurable cost
                 P3 = polish
  Effort         S (<1hr) / M (half day) / L (full day) / XL (multi-day)
  Evidence       path/to/file.ext:120-185 — specific, no hand-waving
  Source Audit   which Phase 1 sub-audit surfaced this (1.2A, 1.2B, 1.2C, 1.3, 
                 1.5, etc.)
  Why It Matters 2–3 sentences of concrete impact, not vibes
  Execution Plan 2–4 ordered steps; files to be created / modified / deleted. 
                 Actionable for a downstream executor. You are NOT executing it.
  Verification   measurable success criteria — NOT "looks cleaner"
  Risk           what could break: callers, consumers, downstream modules
  Depends On     other task IDs that must complete first (or "none")
  Confidence     HIGH (verified from code) / MEDIUM (strong signal, light 
                 assumption) / NEEDS-VERIFICATION (flag for human review)

CATEGORIES
  ARCH  Architectural decomposition, layering, coupling, boundary violations
  BUG   Logic & stability — verifiable from code. Speculation goes in 
        NEEDS-VERIFICATION, not BUG.
  TYPE  Type / interface integrity (any-types, unsafe casts, weak contracts)
  PERF  Performance issues with measurable impact
  SEC   Security: input validation gaps, secret handling, injection surfaces
  DX    Developer experience (build, lint, docs, tooling)
  TEST  Coverage gaps on critical paths

Every COMPLIANCE matrix violation (Pass A, B, or C) should map to at least one 
task. Every ANTI-PATTERN finding with real impact should map to at least one 
task. Every "NOT FULFILLED" purpose finding should map to at least one task.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINAL OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
End the document with these four sections, in order:

  1. SUMMARY TABLE — every task: ID, Title, Severity, Effort, Confidence, 
     Source Audit, Depends On.
  2. RECOMMENDED BATCHES — tasks grouped into independently-shippable batches in 
     execution order. Each batch gets a one-line rationale.
  3. OPEN QUESTIONS — anything needing human clarification. NEEDS-VERIFICATION 
     items that could change severity surface here. Items from 1.9.B that are 
     gaps go here.
  4. NOT FLAGGED — things you considered and deliberately excluded, one line each. 
     Include anything you steel-manned in 1.9.D and decided was actually fine.

The codebase remains untouched. Stop there.

Begin Phase 0.
